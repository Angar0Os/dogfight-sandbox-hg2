The game features : 
* VR (on any SteamVR compatible headset)
* Ocean / terrain shader
* Skydome shader
* Clouds
* Autopilot (Take-off, landing, fight)
* Network mode

The source code and the graphics assets are made available for studying purpose. However, you are free to fork this repository, extend the game or release anything that is based on it.

## How to run the Dogfight Sandbox
1. Download the [most recent release](https://github.com/harfang3d/dogfight-sandbox-hg2/releases) (dogfight-sandbox-hg2-win64.7z)
1. Unzip it
1. run *start.bat*
1. Select a scenario using the `right` and `left` keys
   * Press `space` if you want to control the aircraft using the keyboard
   * Press the `start` button of the gamepad or the joystick depending on the device you want to use
   * If you press the `start/fire` button on the gamepad, the Sandbox will automatically define this controler as the input device of the aircraft (see **Aircraft keyboard Commands** below for the details of the keyboard inputs) 

(If you want to run the sandbox _from the cloned repository_, you will need to copy the Python and HARFANG binaries as well as the other modules in the [bin folder](https://github.com/harfang3d/dogfight-sandbox-hg2/tree/main/bin)). Follow the instructions detailled in the readme files found in each folder.

## About VR mode
* VR works on Windows machines only, using the DirectX backend (set `"OpenGL": false` in the **config.json** file)
* All the views are available in VR (exterior, interior). When using the cockpit view (`3` on the numpad), press `F11` to calibrate the position of the head
* Requires SteamVR (1.22.x) at least
* Tested on the following headsets with success:
  * LENOVO VR Explorer
  * HTC Vive Pro
  * Meta Quest 2 (in Oculus Link mode)

### Events:
Hits (missiles, machine gun, crashes) are recorded and displayed as circles during replay:  
![Recorder](screenshots/recorder_05.png)
Yellow circles : before the event  
Red circles : after the event  
The maximum size of the circle depends on the power of the collision.


## Network mode overview

The "Network" mode allows you to control the planes from a third party machine.  
### Startup:
1. On the server machine:  
    * Start the DogFight SandBox (start.bat file)  
    * Choose the **Network mode** mission
